      In an interview with MIT Technology Review in November <br>
      2020, when asked about freedom of speech, Agrawal said:<br>
      "Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our <br>
      role is to serve a healthy public conversation ... [and to] focus <br>
      less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed."[17]
